# Taxi Pool

Taxi Pool is a taxi sharing app which gathers travelers in IRC style chat rooms. 
 
When users start the app they can check trip channels according to their origin, destination and time.  
If there isn't any trip suitable, users can create a trip for next 24 hours from maps tab. This trip becomes a  chat room for other users to join.  

 Nicknames are autogenerated. All users are  anonymous. Chat rooms and all messages are deleted after the trip.  You will arrange possible routes, meeting point and sharing taxi costs yourself in the chat rooms.

After you complete your trip you can rate your travel mates by their avatar. Please ask them their avatar during the trip. You can upload your own avatar by long pressing the picture frame in the profile page.
